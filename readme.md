## Markov-Generator
A fairly standard Markov text generator thing.

This thing opens up a .txt of your choice and creates a single sentence from a Markov chain using the RiTa library. (https://rednoise.org/rita/)
Most of the code is developed from the example on their page.

The display part of it uses the p5.js library (http://p5js.org/).

Outside of Firefox, you might need to run a local server to make this work. The p5.js github page gives good instructions on how to do this: (https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server)

Have fun with it!
