## Markov-Generator
A fairly standard Markov text generator thing.

This thing opens up a .txt of your choice and creates a single sentence from a Markov chain using the RiTa library. (https://rednoise.org/rita/)
Most of the code is developed from the example on their page.

The display part of it uses the p5.js library (http://p5js.org/).

Have fun with it!
